  description: 'Advanced nuclear reactors often involve complex geometries, unique materials, and new physical regimes. To simulate the coupled physics in such designs, current tools must be extended to capture those geometries, materials, and regimes. Our work focuses on extending current tools with features essential to simulating advanced reactor multiphysics.'

  description: 'Our nuclear energy future may involve a mixture of technologies, reprocessing schemes, and waste managent strategies. Deployments may be driven by politics or demand, the options may be constrained by complex logistics, and the assessment of impacts requires analysis at scale. Our work focuses on modeling, simulation, and $analysis of the global nuclear fuel cycle, with an emphasis on sustainability.'
