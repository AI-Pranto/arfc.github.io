  description: 'Postdoctoral scholars are exceptional early career researchers who join the research group to pursue one or more ambitious projects suited to a future in a research-focused career. They should have received a Ph.D. in their area of research within the last 3 years and may be seated in either NCSA or NPRE, depending on the topic of their work.'

  description: 'Our nuclear energy future may involve a mixture of technologies, reprocessing schemes, and waste managent strategies. Deployments may be driven by politics or demand, the options may be constrained by complex logistics, and the assessment of impacts requires analysis at scale. Our work focuses on modeling, simulation, and $analysis of the global nuclear fuel cycle, with an emphasis on sustainability.'

    - title: "Predicting the Past with Nuclear Fuel Cycle Simulation"
      description: "
      To inform nuclear energy technology and policy, the broad technical, economic, political, and environmental aspects of nuclear energy must be modeled, simulated, analyzed, and predicted at deployment scale. The Cyclus framework is an open source, modular, agent-based library for this kind of nuclear fuel cycle simulation. The Cyclus project offers the followin opportunity:
              
              To validate its accuracy, the Cyclus tool must be able to predict the past. We seek a student to set up and conduct Cyclus simulations that accurately predict and simulate the history of nuclear energy. Starting at the dawn of commercial nuclear power, the student will define the initial conditions and deployment of reactors as they were deployed historically using what we know (wikidata, IAEA records, etc.) to approximate operating histories, deployment rules, power consumption growth rates, and other details. This simulation should approximate as closely as possible the true history of nuclear power deployment and arrive at what we know to be the existing stored fuel inventory. Ideally, the student will work with our team to publish a conference paper or journal article on this benchmark result. Though learning through doing is integral to this effort, applicants must be comfortable in UNIX/Linux environments. Applicants with experience using SQL, HDF5, XML, Python, and C++ will be preferred.

The Cyclus framework is an open source, modular, agent-based library for this kind of nuclear fuel cycle simulation. The Cyclus project offers the following opportunity:

              To assess the geographic impacts of nuclear energy, simulate regional variations in energy deployment, and optimize placement of new facilities, Cyclus agents (Facilities, Institutions, and Regions) must possess a notion of their own location . We seek a student who will implement a lightweight location data attribute to enrich Agent class objects in the Cyclus nuclear fuel cycle simulation framework. The student will implement necessary unit tests, add documentation, and demonstrate the rich use of this attribute in existing models. Ideally, the student will work with our team to prepare a conference paper or journal article on this benchmark result.

The Cyclus framework is an open source, modular, agent-based library for this kind of nuclear fuel cycle simulation. The Cyclus project offers the following opportunity:

To assess the geographic impacts of nuclear energy and optimize placement of new facilities, Cyclus is in need of a rich geospatial information dataset. We seek a student to create and populate a large data library with geospatial information relevant to nuclear energy. In particular, the student will scrape the web to create a self-updating database of nuclear power plant locations, other nuclear fuel cycle facility locations, existing spent nuclear fuel storage locations, related infrastructure, the electric grid, and other information layers. Extensive use of data APIs (e.g. WikiData), scripting (e.g., python), database. This data capability will be developed in the open alongside Cyclus, but will ideally be distributed for more general use and will be published in a cite-able and open manner. Though learning through doing is integral to this effort, applicants must have some knowledge of Python. Applicants with experience using SQL, HDF5, XML, and C++ will be preferred.
