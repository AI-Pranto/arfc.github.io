This page is an index of the growing set of guides behind the operations of the 
research group. It is intended to be a living document capturing the overviews 
and checklists for mastering the practical, administrative, and computational 
infrastructure that ARFC relies on for various common tasks. All research group 
members should contribute to this section early and often. If possible, link to 
github repositories, gists, or Jupyter notebooks when there is a guide item 
that can be captured in one.
