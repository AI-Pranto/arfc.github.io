# Zotero

Zotero is a convenient tool that allows a creation
of a nice, organized library that can be exported to
a .bib file later on!


## Get Started

Start with the obvious by 
[creating an account](https://www.zotero.org/user/register/) 
and joining the
[arfc group library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/arfc). 

## Install Zotero Plugins

Go to [www.zotero.org/download](www.zotero.org/download) and follow the instructions. 

If you use firefox:

1. Download Zotero Firefox Application:
2. That's it for now.


If you use something else (e.g. Chrome)

1. Download the Zotero Standalone application. 
2. Add the Zotero extension to your browser.

## To Store References:

1. Open Zotero Standalone.
2. Go to a folder (either personal or group) that you'd like to store the reference on.
3. In your browser, click on the icon that says 'save to Zotero'.
4. Done.

### The Tricky Part

In order to 'properly' store papers and refernces, one must do so with caution.

#### Best Option: Google Scholar

Search for the article in [Google Scholar](scholar.google.com)
This will most likely ensure that the browser plugin will have access to all
the necessary information for proper citing.

You should aim to add the paper in the 'introduction page' of the paper, not the paper itself.
The first picture is when you click 'save to Zotero', not the second.

See that the one from fig 3 does not contain the author and year created, which is not a good reference.
See that the one from fig 2 does have all the information, which is good for a reference.

You can also try to maually get the data by right clicking the 'bad' reference and clicking on 
'Retrieve Metadata for PDF'.
It can fail.

For Web Pages, just click the 'Save to Zotero' icon.
If any crucial item is missing, type it in yourself.
tip: type in:

javascript:(alert(document.lastModified)

 in the address line to see when it was last modified.
