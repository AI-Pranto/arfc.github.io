#Zotero
Zotero is a convenient tool that allows a creation
of a nice, organized library that can be exported to
a bib file later on!


## Get Started:
The obvious:  
Create Account,  
get into arfc group library   
    
## Next Step:

go to [www.zotero.org/download](www.zotero.org/download)

If you use firefox:  
1. Download Zotero Firefox Application:  
2. That's it for now.  


If you use something else (we'll use Chrome for Example:)  
1. Download the Zotero Standalone.  
2. Add one of the extensions to your browser.  

## To 'Store' papers / references:

1. Open Zotero Standalone.  
2. Go to a folder (either personal or group) that you'd like to store the reference on.  
3. In your browser, click on the icon that says 'save to Zotero'.  
4. Done.  

### The Tricky Part
In oder to 'properly' store papers and refernces, one must do so with caution.  

Best: Add from [Google Scholars](scholar.google.com)
This will most likely ensure all the information for proper citing:

You should aim to add the paper in the 'introduction page' of the paper, not the paper itself.
The first picture is when you click 'save to Zotero', not the second.

See that the one from fig 3 does not contain the author and year created, which is not a good reference.
See that the one from fig 2 does have all the information, which is good for a reference.

You can also try to maually get the data by right clicking the 'bad' reference and clicking on 
'Retrieve Metadata for PDF'.
It can fail.

For Web Pages, just click the 'Save to Zotero' icon.
If any crucial item is missing, type it in yourself.
tip: type in 'javascript:(alert(document.lastModified)' in the address line to see when it was last modified.
