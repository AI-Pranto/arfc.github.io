# Traveling

Traveling for ARFC purposes should be done in these 10 steps:


### 1. Determine a reason and plan for travel (Plan Ahead!)
###### ex) I would like to go to Charlotte, NC for the International High Level Radioactive Waste Conference and present my accepted paper, from April 9th to 13th.

### 2. Communicate with Prof. Huff on the travel. Get her approval.

### 3. Estimate cost and decide whether to get it prepaid by the department, or get reimbursed later.
###### note: If you want to pay and get reimbursed, it will take ~5 months to receive reimbursement.

### 4. go to [my.npre.illinois.edu](my.npre.illinois.edu) -> HR APPS -> Travel

### 5. Click 'Create Request'
###### note: if you are a TA, make sure you communicate with your course instructor regarding the absence.

### 6. Fill out the form, and the account number should be provided by Prof. Huff
###### Note: It differs by what grant you are under! Don't use someone else's!

### 7. Get it approved by the Supervisor

### 8. Purchase flights, hotels and everything
###### Note: It's best to get government rates for the hotel where the conference is at. Airbnb can be unreliable. 

### 9. Go on the trip. Be safe!

### 10. After the trip, log in to the [Travel Expense Management (TEM) Services](https://www.obfs.uillinois.edu/tem-resources/) by clicking on the LOG IN button tomorrow. 

### 11. If you are not authorized to log in, you might have to contact Tessa M Hile (tmhile@illinois.edu) for authorization (She is our department USC)

### 12. Go to the NPRE main office to pick up the Travel Itinerary Reimbursement Form

### 13. Fill out the Form, be very very detailed, I recommend using a following format:
1. Write down the basic information (name, contact, account number etc)
2. Print out a separate sheet for the descriptions
and writing 'SEE ATTACHED' in the actual form [example](/img/manual/guides/tra-example.pdf)
3. Print out all the receipts from the travel (airfare, lodging are major ones)
4. The table is PER DAY, means that each row is a day
5. For the first and last day, you must state the day of departure and arrival of your mode of transportation
6. `Per Diem - Circle meals requested` is where you circle meals that were NOT PROVIDED BY THE CONFERENCE, and the ones you had to pay for. The reimbursements are set as $6.50 for breakfast and lunch, and $19 for dinner, total up to $32 per day.
7. Explain EVERYTHING at `Other details or further explanation`

### 14. Recommendations and Tips:

1. If you presented a paper (or a poster presentation), it is beneficial to attach a copy of your paper.
2. Be EXTREMELY detailed (if you think 'do I really need this?' - just attach it and write it)

### 15. Get it signed by your PI (sponsor of the trip)

### 16. Organize everything, put it in an envelope and give it to Barbara J. Russell

### 17. If you followed this guide, your submission will be pleasing to her eyes.

### 18. Later you will get an email from someone who's supposed to fill out the actual online form for you,
add that person as a 'proxy' by logging into TEM -> My info -> Creator Proxy

### 19. Now the person will do your form for you, and let you know when to press the submit button or if there is any error or if your submission needs revision.
