# Traveling

Traveling for ARFC purposes should be done in these 10 steps:


### 1. Determine a reason and plan for travel (Plan Ahead!)
###### ex) I would like to go to Charlotte, NC for the International High Level Radioactive Waste Conference and present my accepted paper, from April 9th to 13th.

### 2. Communicate with Prof. Huff on the travel. Get her approval.

### 3. Estimate cost and decide whether to get it prepaid by the department, or get reimbursed later.
###### note: If you want to pay and get reimbursed, it will take ~5 months to receive reimbursement.

### 4. go to [my.npre.illinois.edu](my.npre.illinois.edu) -> HR APPS -> Travel

### 5. Click 'Create Request'
###### note: if you are a TA, make sure you communicate with your course instructor regarding the absence.

### 6. Fill out the form, and the account number should be provided by Prof. Huff
###### Note: It differs by what grant you are under! Don't use someone else's!

### 7. Get it approved by the Supervisor

### 8. Purchase flights, hotels and everything
###### Note: It's best to get government rates for the hotel where the conference is at. Airbnb can be unreliable. 

### 9. Go on the trip. Be safe!

### 10. After the trip, fill out the [Travel Expense Management (TEM) form](https://www.obfs.uillinois.edu/tem-resources/)
