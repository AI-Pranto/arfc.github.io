3.1. The Tricky Part:
In order to 'properly' store papers and references, one must do so with caution.

Best way: Add from scholar.google.com search page:
this will most likely ensure all the information for proper citing.

You should aim to add the paper in the 'introduction page' of the paper, not the paper itself.

See that the one from fig 3 does not contain the author and year created, which is not a good reference.
See that the one from fig 2 does have all the information, which is good for a reference.


You can try to manually get the data by right clicking the bad reference and clicking on 'Retrieve Metadata for PDF'.
It can fail.

For Web Pages, just click the 'Save to Zotero' icon.
If any crucial item is missing, type it in yourself.
tip: type in 'javascript:alert(document.lastModified)' in the address line to see when it was last modified.
