This part of the website is intended to be a living document capturing the 
norms and processes behing this research group. The following sections were 
inspired by [Lab Carpentry](http://labcarpentry.org) and its implementation at 
the [Data Exploration Laboratory](https://dxl.ncsa.illinois.edu/). 

# Mission

The **[mission](/manual/mission)** section is a place to state our evolving vision for the safe, 
sustainable future of nuclear energy through advanced modeling and simulation 
of advanced reactors and fuel cycles.


# Expectations

The section on **[expectations](/manual/expectations)** addresses mutual 
expectations among members of the group, with special attention to 
student-advisor expectations. Again, a great deal of this section came from Lab 
Carpentry and DXL, but other inspiration also came from [Chris 
Blattman](http://chrisblattman.com/graduate-advising/), [Paul 
Wilson](http://cnerg.github.io/), [Carl 
Boettiger](http://www.carlboettiger.info), and lots of posts on [the Professor 
Hacker Blog](http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/).

# Code of Conduct

The mutual expectations within the group are built on a foundation of 
respect, integrity, and professional conduct. In addition to institutional 
standards, this group upholds our own evolving **[code of conduct](/manual/coc)**.

# Guides

**[The guides](/manual/guides/guides)** are a set of overviews and checklists 
for mastering the practical, administrative, and computational infrastructure 
ARFC relies on for various common tasks. All research group members should 
contribute to this section early and often. The various channels through which 
we communicate both internally and externally are documented in a set of 
communication guides.
