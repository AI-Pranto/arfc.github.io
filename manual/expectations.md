# Behavior
All members of the research group are required to agree with the [code of conduct](/manual/coc). 

# Katy's Responsibilities as PI

- **Be supportive:** at all times. Universities are places of growth and 
  challenge. I recognize that times will occasionally be dark. With the long
- **Pursue funding:** 
- **Provide feedback:**  on research and career goals
- Protect students from administrative and paperwork issues
- **Guide Research:** in both large and small scale ways. I will help students 
  to select PhD or Masters projects at the larger scalle. At the smaller scale, 
  I will help to guide short term progress toward those accomplishments.
- **Provide course guidance:** I will 
- **Provide space and supplies:** including a physical working space, 
  furniture, necessary computational resources, and virtual resources such as 
  software licenses.
- **Support conference travel:** when funding is available and students have 
  work to present. 
- **Sign stuff:** I'll sign stuff when you need it signed. 
- **Help to define and enforce timelines:** when those are needed. That is, 
  while not all students want or need externally enforced deadlines and 
  specifically defined goals, many students thrive when periodic expectations 
  drive them to complete work toward their degree. Unless you prefer a 
  hands-off approach I will help you to define your goals and hold you to them 
  in a way that keeps us both running a tight ship.
- **Connect you to my network:** whenever possible. I will connect students to 
  my professional network when it may be helpful to students as they seek out 
  external experts, additional mentors, summer internships, and careers. 
- Leading, writing, and editing manuscripts

# Postdoc Responsibilities

- **Be present:** I expect you to be accessible during normal working hours. 
  Feel free to follow a schedule that works for you, work from home once in a 
  while when you need to, and take breaks when you want to. But, by default, 
  plan to come to the office during the daytime with regularity.  I won't track 
  your hours, but I will worry if I haven't seen your face all week.
- **Write:** papers and software toward the advancement of science in your 
  field, building your career and expertise. 
- **Provide expertise:** I and my graduate students are relying on you to be an 
  expert in your work and to share that expertise during collaboration. This 
  may take the form of presenting at lab meetings, providing feedback to 
  graduate students, or taking leadership in scholarly work.
- **Collaborate:** I very much hope that you will involve other members of the 
  research group (myself included) in the work that you do as a postdoc. We are 
  ready to share our effort, support, expertise, feedback, and ideas. 


# Graduate Student Responsibilities

Students who are my advisees have many responsibilities to themselves, to me, and to one another. 

## Required 

- **Stay in good standing:** with the graduate school by meeting graduate 
  school requirements, filling out paperwork on time, registering for classes 
  on time, completing milestones satisfactorily, passing any qualifying exams,
  and scheduling committee meetings annually. 
- **Be responsible:** 
- keep research as a priority
- develop research projects with the help of the PI
- Be present: maintain an average working rate according to your employment support
- participate
- attend and regularly present at lab meetings 
- identify research milestones and goals
- make progress
- submit weekly reports
- Graduate promptly: I expect MS students to take two years and PhD students to 
  take less than five years to complete all requirements and thesis defenses. 
  Of course there may be exceptions, but extenuating circumstances should be 
  communicated well in advance. My role includes helping you to formulate a 
  feasible thesis project. Yours, in turn, includes meeting the goals of that 
  project or communicating when those deadlines are infeasible.
